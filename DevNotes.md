I should try and have a radius around the player that the pug will avoid being
inside of during the run state

add a small radius around the Pug that will make it catch the player if they
stand too close to it

make it so a sound plays when the gun fires that makes the pug find the player 
immediately (within a certain range)

the look_at() function for the pug is not working rn and honestly I have no clue why

Make it so the bulletholes will show up on the trees

make a model for the phone
